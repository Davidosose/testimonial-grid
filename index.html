        <h1> I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned <br>were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I <br>honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h1>
        <article>“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a <br>transition and brhave heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for <br>the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 <br>weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve <br>successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</article>

    <h1>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy. </h1>
    <article>“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The <br> program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present <br>myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the <br>personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</article>

        <h1>Such a life-changing <br>experience. Highly <br> recommended!</h1>
        <article>“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve <br> never written a line of code. I needed <br>some structure from professionals <br>who can help me learn programming <br>step by step. I was encouraged to <br>enroll by a former student of theirs <br>who can only say wonderful things <br> about the program. The entire <br>curriculum and staff did not <br>disappoint. They were very hands-on <br>and I never had to wait long for <br>assistance. The agile team project, in <br>particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In <br>fact, I’ve often referred to it during <br>interviews as an example of my <br>developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack <br>developer after receiving multiple <br>offers. 100% recommend! ”</article>
